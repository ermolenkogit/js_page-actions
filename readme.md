# Page actions

## The task

1) Remove all ad units from the page (right side of the site).

2) Change the genre of the movie, change "comedy" to "drama".

3) Change the background of the movie poster to "bg.jpg". It's in the img folder.
This can only be implemented by means of JS.

4) I want to generate a list of films on the page based on the data from this JS file.
Sort them alphabetically. 

5) Add numbering to the output movies.
